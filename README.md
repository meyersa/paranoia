# Paranoia Module
That was the best name I could come up with 

## Goal
Automate offensive security scanning of infrastructure

- Lookups on Shodan.io 
- Active NMap scans 
- Querying status of IP against Crowdsec
- Ensuring Geo location
- Lookups on Google

## Plan 
3 parts: 
- Frontend Dashboard
- Backend Services
    - Shodan poller
    - Nmap scanner
    - Crowdsec poller
    - Geo Lookup
    - Google lookup?
- MongoDB



> The google lookup might not actually happen
